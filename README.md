- Code Challenge solution -

The application can be executed from the class com/gumtree/uk/main/Main.java

It prints on the Output Console the answers for the three questions required for the code challenge.

The address book file give n as example is located under the resource folder. It's possible to test the application on other file,
but need to be upload in the resource folder and change the name from the call in the main.

I made two assumptions:
1) the address book contains only one row with the same name as the question gives only the name. We will need more info to make the person read from the address book unique.
  In a real case, of course we will need to use multiple values or a unique identifier.
  (Name, gender and DoB could still not be enough)
2) the date of birth is in the format dd/MM/yy
